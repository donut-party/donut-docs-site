              Donut is a framework for building, deploying, and growing your
              software-as-a-service business. It's designed to let you focus
              on your core product, not on endless unrelated chores. Coming soon!

              <p class="mb-2">
                Donut's goal is to ridiculously reduce the amount of effort it takes to release
                your product. Creating any SaaS product involves innumerable tasks that are incidental
                to your product's core value proposition, and Donut is meant to handle those for you.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Such tasks include: figuring out how to handle forms and navigation, handling API requests
                and responses, wiring up OAuth, and a lot more. The Donut design approach is to identify
                these burdensome tasks and provide the underlying structure that lets us build an ecosystem
                of solutions for these tasks - without compromising your code's maintainability and
                extensibility. And it provides many of the solutions itself :)

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Stay Fast</h2>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Frameworks have a reputation for saving work in the short term but creating more work in the
                long term by obscuring how your code works (magic!) and creating a walled garden.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Donut attempts to avoid these pitfalls by adding just a little structure on top of libraries
                that are already widely-adopted in the Clojure community, like reitit and re-frame. If Donut
                doesn't do what you need, you're not locked in: you can just use these well-supported tools.

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Beyond the app: Build your business</h2>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Building your business is more than just creating core product. It's managing payments,
                customers, monitoring, integrations, and on and on.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Donut's still in its infancy, but long-term it aims to take a wholistic approach to product
                development to support you in building your business.

              <p class="mb-2">
                My vision for Donut is to empower anybody to be productive with Clojure. By creating
                a starting place that's as close as possible to the finish line, we make Clojure
                more appealing and help newcomers stay motivated as they learn the language.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-2">
                I specifically want to empower people in a way that can benefit them financially. It's tough
                out there, and if we could give people great tools to improve their situations, that'd
                be awesome!
              </p>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Along the way, I'd like to build a supportive community. With Clojure and kindness, there's
                no limit to what we can achieve! <a href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C030C4Z2W0Y" class="text-sky-600">Join us in the #donut channel in Clojurians slack</a>
