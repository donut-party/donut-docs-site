title: You First System
---


## Notes

* Start with data structure
* ::ds/defs
* what is a system?
* error messages if you get it wrong
* component which does nothing
* explain all the keys involved
* point out what's relevant, what's not
* donut.system exposes a lot, that's what makes it extensible
